## Task Organization Rules

- **Current Tasks (This File)**: Tasks actively being worked on RIGHT NOW (max 1-3 groups)  
- **Backlog**: Use `backlog.md` for planned future tasks
- **Completed**: Move to `done.md` when tasks are complete with all tests passing

When starting new work:
1. Move tasks from `backlog.md` â†’ `general.md` (this file)
2. Work on tasks and update progress
3. Move completed tasks from `general.md` â†’ `done.md`
