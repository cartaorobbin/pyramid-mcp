# General Project Tasks and Infrastructure

This file tracks **CURRENT and ACTIVE** tasks that are being worked on right now for the pyramid-mcp project.

## üöß ACTIVE TASKS

### [2025-01-28] Route Discovery Feature Implementation

**Status**: TODO üìã
**Assigned**: Available for next development cycle
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Related Issue**: From backlog - implementing route discovery for MCP tools

#### Plan
Move the next priority feature from backlog to active development:
- Route Discovery feature (currently in backlog.md)
- This will provide automatic tool generation from Pyramid routes
- See `planning/backlog.md` for detailed implementation plan

#### Next Steps
1. Review route discovery requirements in backlog
2. Plan implementation phases
3. Begin development when ready

## üìä Current Status

**All major infrastructure AND Claude integration completed!** ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Modern pytest-based test suite with 94+ tests, 75%+ coverage
- ‚úÖ **Plugin Architecture**: Full Pyramid plugin with includeme function
- ‚úÖ **Tool Registration**: Easy @tool decorator for automatic registration
- ‚úÖ **Settings Integration**: Comprehensive mcp.* settings support
- ‚úÖ **Examples**: Working example application demonstrating usage
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API still works unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Security**: JWT authentication and context factory integration
- ‚úÖ **Docker**: Development environment with Docker-in-Docker support
- ‚úÖ **Claude Desktop Integration**: Complete Docker-based integration with stdio transport
- ‚úÖ **Stdio Transport**: CLI-based MCP server for Claude Desktop compatibility

**Recently Completed Claude Integration:**
- ‚úÖ **Docker Container Creation**: Multi-stage Dockerfile with security best practices
- ‚úÖ **Stdio Transport Implementation**: Full JSON-RPC stdin/stdout communication
- ‚úÖ **Claude Desktop Configuration**: Working claude_desktop_config.json setup
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Integration**: Pre-configured API keys for seamless access
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Complete setup guides and troubleshooting

The project now provides excellent developer experience for both HTTP-based MCP integration and Claude Desktop compatibility through Docker containers.

## Next Steps

**Immediate Focus:**
1. **Route Discovery Feature**: Move from backlog to active development
2. **Open Source Preparation**: PyPI publishing setup and public repository preparation
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: Expand API documentation and usage examples

**Available from Backlog:**
- Route Discovery feature implementation (Phases 1-5 planned)
- Open Source & PyPI Publishing setup  
- Enhanced testing and CI/CD improvements

The core infrastructure is solid and Claude integration is complete. Ready to move to feature development and open source preparation.

## üìù Task Management Notes

**Active vs Backlog:**
- **This file (`general.md`)**: Only tasks currently being worked on
- **`planning/backlog.md`**: All planned future tasks (prioritized)
- **`planning/done.md`**: All completed tasks (historical archive)

**Workflow:**
1. Work on tasks in this file until completion
2. Move completed tasks to `done.md`
3. Pull next priority tasks from `backlog.md` into this file
4. Keep this file focused and manageable (max 1-3 active task groups)

## Next Steps

**Immediate Focus:**
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Simple Docker testing - Docker works! (Phase 2.5)
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Docker integration for Claude Desktop (Phase 2)
3. **NEXT UP**: Extend pyramid_mcp with stdio transport (Phase 2.6)
4. Finish Claude integration documentation (Phase 3)

**Planned from Backlog:**
1. Route Discovery feature completion (Phases 2-5)
2. Open Source & PyPI Publishing setup
3. Enhanced route discovery implementation

The core infrastructure is solid. Current focus is on Claude Desktop integration, then moving to route discovery feature completion from the backlog.
