config.include('pyramid_mcp')
config.registry.settings.update({
    'mcp.server_name': 'my-api',
    'mcp.mount_path': '/api/mcp'
})

# Register tools
@tool(description="Add two numbers")
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

### [2024-12-28] Fix Deferred Configuration for Route Discovery

**Status**: DONE ✅
**Assigned**: Assistant  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
**Actual Time**: ~20 minutes

#### Plan
- [x] Fix includeme function to use proper Pyramid deferred configuration
- [x] Use config.action() with high order priority to run after all scans
- [x] Remove requirement for users to manually control scan timing
- [x] Test that route discovery works with natural configuration order
- [x] Verify all existing tests still pass

#### Progress
- [x] ✅ Updated includeme() to use config.action() with order=999999
- [x] ✅ Deferred setup runs after all configuration including scans
- [x] ✅ Reverted simple_app.py to use natural order (include, then scan)
- [x] ✅ All 72 tests pass confirming functionality works
- [x] ✅ Route discovery tests pass showing tools are discovered correctly

#### Technical Details
- **Pyramid config.action()**: Used deferred configuration system properly
- **High Priority Order**: order=999999 ensures MCP setup runs very late
- **Natural Order**: Users can now use standard Pyramid patterns without timing issues
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

#### Outcomes
- **Better DX**: Users don't need to worry about include/scan timing
- **Pyramid Conventions**: Follows standard Pyramid plugin patterns
- **All Tests Pass**: 72/72 tests pass with 79% coverage
- **Route Discovery Works**: Auto-discovery functions correctly with natural order

#### User Experience Improvement
Before:
```python
config.add_route('api_users', '/api/users')
config.scan()  # Required to be called first
config.include('pyramid_mcp')  # Then include
```

After:
```python  
config.add_route('api_users', '/api/users')
config.include('pyramid_mcp')  # Include anywhere
config.scan()  # Scan anywhere - order doesn't matter
```

The fix makes pyramid-mcp work like a proper Pyramid plugin with deferred configuration.

### [2024-12-28] Implement Real Route Calling for Auto-Discovered Tools

**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Assigned**: Assistant  
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours

#### Plan
- [ ] Analyze current `_create_route_handler` function that returns simulation data
- [ ] Design proper request/response flow for calling actual Pyramid views
- [ ] Implement request object creation with proper matchdict and params
- [ ] Handle HTTP method routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) correctly
- [ ] Convert MCP tool arguments to proper request parameters
- [ ] Call the actual view callable and handle the response
- [ ] Convert Pyramid response back to MCP tool response format
- [ ] Test with pytest webtest to to ensure auto-discovered tools work properly
- [ ] Verify all existing tests still pass

#### Progress
- [x] ✅ Identified that `_create_route_handler` returns simulation data instead of calling views
- [ ] Analyzing Pyramid request/response flow for proper implementation
- [ ] Implementing actual route calling functionality

#### Technical Requirements
- **Request Creation**: Create proper Pyramid request objects with matchdict, params, and body
- **Method Handling**: Support GET (query params), POST/PUT (JSON body), DELETE properly
- **View Calling**: Invoke the actual Pyramid view callable with proper context
- **Response Handling**: Convert Pyramid responses to MCP-compatible format
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for HTTP errors, validation failures
- **Testing**: Ensure manual tools still work alongside route-discovered tools

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Minimal Request Object**: Create a lightweight request object with necessary attributes
2. **Parameter Mapping**: Map MCP tool arguments to request parameters based on HTTP method
3. **View Invocation**: Call the view callable directly with the request object
4. **Response Conversion**: Convert view response to MCP tool response format
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality remains unchanged

#### Expected Outcomes
- Auto-discovered tools will call actual Pyramid view functions
- MCP clients will receive real API responses instead of simulation data
- Full integration between MCP protocol and Pyramid view layer
- Comprehensive testing confirms functionality works end-to-end

## Current Status

**All major infrastructure tasks completed!** ✅

- ✅ **Testing**: Modern pytest-based test suite with 37 tests, 69% coverage
- ✅ **Plugin Architecture**: Full Pyramid plugin with includeme function
- ✅ **Tool Registration**: Easy @tool decorator for automatic registration
- ✅ **Settings Integration**: Comprehensive mcp.* settings support
