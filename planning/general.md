  - Added Python 3.12 support
  - Updated to latest action versions
  - Improved workflow structure and naming
  - Added comprehensive test coverage
- [x] **Created comprehensive documentation**: 
  - Added `docs/publishing.md` with complete PyPI publishing guide
  - Updated `docs/index.md` to include publishing guide
  - Included troubleshooting section and best practices
- [x] **Added test publishing workflow**: 
  - Created `test-pypi.yml` for testing package builds
  - Added TestPyPI publishing for manual testing
  - Included package verification and installation testing
- [x] **Updated project configuration**:
  - Added Python 3.12 support to `pyproject.toml`
  - Updated repository URLs from placeholders
  - Verified tox.ini already includes Python 3.12
- [x] **Fixed code quality issues**:

  - Fixed line length issue in `introspection.py`
  - Removed unused import in `test_pyramid_tm_integration.py`
  - All tests pass: `make test` âœ…
  - All quality checks pass: `make check` âœ…

### Decisions Made
- **Trusted Publishing**: Using PyPI's trusted publishing feature instead of API tokens for better security
- **Modern Actions**: Updated to latest GitHub Actions versions (v4/v5)
- **Python 3.12**: Added support for Python 3.12 across all workflows
- **Test Publishing**: Created separate workflow for testing builds without publishing
- **Environment Protection**: Using GitHub environments for additional security

### Deliverables
- âœ… **Updated `.github/workflows/on-release-pypi.yml`**: Modern PyPI publishing with trusted publishing
- âœ… **Updated `.github/workflows/main.yml`**: Comprehensive CI with latest actions
- âœ… **Created `.github/workflows/test-pypi.yml`**: Test publishing workflow
- âœ… **Created `docs/publishing.md`**: Complete publishing guide
- âœ… **Updated `docs/index.md`**: Added publishing guide reference
- âœ… **Updated `pyproject.toml`**: Python 3.12 support and proper URLs
- âœ… **Code quality fixes**: All formatting and linting issues resolved

### Next Steps for User
1. **Update repository URLs**: Replace placeholder URLs in `pyproject.toml` with actual GitHub repository
2. **Set up PyPI trusted publishing**: 
   - Create PyPI account if needed
   - Configure trusted publishing on PyPI with repository details
3. **Create first release**: 
   - Test with `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`
   - Create GitHub release to trigger automatic PyPI publishing
4. **Optional**: Set up TestPyPI for testing releases before production

### Test Results
- âœ… **All tests passing**: 157 passed, 1 xfailed, 0 failed
- âœ… **Code quality checks**: All black, isort, flake8, mypy checks pass
- âœ… **Package structure**: Proper Poetry configuration for publishing
