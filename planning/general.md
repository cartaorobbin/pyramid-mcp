# Active Tasks - Current Development

This file tracks tasks currently being worked on. Completed tasks get moved to `planning/done.md`.

## üìù Task Management Guidelines

**Workflow:**
1. Work on tasks in this file until completion
2. Move completed tasks to `done.md`
3. Pull next priority tasks from `backlog.md` into this file
4. Keep this file focused and manageable (max 1-3 active task groups)

## üìä Current Status

**All major infrastructure tasks completed!** ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Modern pytest-based test suite with 133+ tests, 75%+ coverage
- ‚úÖ **Plugin Architecture**: Full Pyramid plugin with includeme function
- ‚úÖ **Tool Registration**: Easy @tool decorator for automatic registration
- ‚úÖ **Settings Integration**: Comprehensive mcp.* settings support
- ‚úÖ **Examples**: Working example application demonstrating usage
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API still works unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Security**: JWT authentication and context factory integration
- ‚úÖ **Docker**: Development environment with Docker-in-Docker support
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: 100% compliance with all quality checks (black, flake8, mypy)

The project now follows Pyramid best practices and provides an excellent developer experience for integrating MCP with Pyramid applications.

## Next Steps

**Immediate Focus:**
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Simple Docker testing - Docker works! (Phase 2.5)
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Docker integration for Claude Desktop (Phase 2)
3. ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Code Quality improvements (make check fixes)
4. **NEXT UP**: Extend pyramid_mcp with stdio transport (Phase 2.6)
5. Finish Claude integration documentation (Phase 3)

**Planned from Backlog:**
1. Route Discovery feature completion (Phases 2-5)
2. Open Source & PyPI Publishing setup
3. Enhanced route discovery implementation

The core infrastructure is solid and code quality is excellent. Current focus is on Claude Desktop integration, then moving to route discovery feature completion from the backlog.

## üìù Task Management Notes

**Active vs Backlog:**
- **This file (`general.md`)**: Only tasks currently being worked on
- **`planning/backlog.md`**: All planned future tasks (prioritized)
- **`planning/done.md`**: All completed tasks (historical archive)

**Workflow:**
1. Work on tasks in this file until completion
2. Move completed tasks to `done.md`
3. Pull next priority tasks from `backlog.md` into this file
4. Keep this file focused and manageable (max 1-3 active task groups)

## Current Active Tasks

*No active tasks at the moment. Ready to pull next priority tasks from `planning/backlog.md`.*
