## üìã ACTIVE TASKS

### [2024-12-28] Remove Unused mcp_auth_headers Code

**Status**: DONE ‚úÖ  
**Assigned**: Assistant  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes  
**Related Issue**: User observation - "we don't need request.mcp_auth_headers since we only have one way to create MCP tools"

#### üéØ Problem Analysis
The `request.mcp_auth_headers` mechanism was leftover code from an earlier implementation that is no longer used:

1. **Never assigned**: `mcp_auth_headers` is never actually set anywhere in the codebase
2. **Authentication works without it**: All tests pass, authentication flows through direct header mechanism
3. **Redundant code**: The check always results in empty `auth_headers = {}`
4. **Single tool creation path**: Only view introspection is used, no need for separate auth header mechanism

#### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- [x] **Research**: Confirmed `mcp_auth_headers` is never assigned anywhere
- [x] **Verify tests pass**: All authentication tests work without the mechanism  
- [x] **Remove from requests.py**: Cleaned up unused auth header extraction code
- [x] **Remove from conftest.py**: Updated test security policy to use only HTTP headers
- [x] **Update comments**: Added clarifying comments about authentication flow
- [x] **Run tests**: All 358 tests pass, 2 skipped
- [x] **Code quality**: All `make check` validations pass

#### üéØ Changes Made
1. **Removed unused code** in `pyramid_mcp/introspection/requests.py`:
   - Lines 174-185: `mcp_auth_headers` extraction logic
   - Lines 302-304: Empty auth headers loop
2. **Simplified test security policy** in `tests/conftest.py`:
   - Removed `mcp_auth_headers` check
   - Uses only standard HTTP Authorization headers
3. **Added clarifying comments** about authentication flow

#### ‚úÖ Verification Complete
- ‚úÖ **All tests pass**: 358 passed, 2 skipped
- ‚úÖ **Code quality passes**: `make check` successful
- ‚úÖ **Authentication works**: All auth tests pass (unit + integration + cornice)
- ‚úÖ **No regressions**: Full test suite confirms no functionality lost

### [2024-12-28] Refactor Tool Decorator to Use Cornice Services

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Assigned**: Assistant  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Related Issue**: User request - "refactor tool decorator to use cornice services and remove MCP metadata"

#### üéØ Problem Analysis
Currently the `@tool` decorator has two different discovery paths in introspection:

1. **Cornice service discovery** (the clean path we want to keep) 
2. **MCP metadata discovery** (the `__mcp_tool_*` path we want to remove)

The decorator currently:
- Creates Pyramid views directly with `__mcp_tool_*` metadata attributes
- Uses separate metadata-based discovery path in introspection
- Lives in `core.py` instead of a dedicated file
- Accepts both GET and POST methods

#### üéØ Goal: Unified Cornice-Only Discovery

Refactor the `@tool` decorator to:

1. **Move to `decorators.py`**: Extract from `core.py` for better organization
2. **Create Cornice services**: Instead of Pyramid views with metadata
3. **Auto-generate schemas**: From function signatures (no user-defined schemas)  
4. **POST-only endpoints**: Restrict to POST for schema validation
5. **Remove metadata discovery**: Eliminate `__mcp_tool_*` attributes completely
6. **Maintain error format**: Keep current `{"error": "...", "tool_name": "..."}` format
7. **Keep naming conventions**: `tool_{tool_name}` and `/mcp/tools/{tool_name}`

#### üìã Implementation Plan

- [ ] **Task 1**: Create `pyramid_mcp/decorators.py` file
- [ ] **Task 2**: Move `tool` decorator class from `core.py` to `decorators.py`
- [ ] **Task 3**: Refactor decorator to create Cornice services instead of views
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement auto-schema generation from function signatures
- [ ] **Task 5**: Remove all `__mcp_tool_*` metadata code from decorator
- [ ] **Task 6**: Remove metadata-based discovery path from `introspection.py`
- [ ] **Task 7**: Update imports in `__init__.py` to expose decorator from new location
- [ ] **Task 8**: Run tests and fix any issues with unified discovery

#### üîß Technical Design

**New Decorator Behavior:**
```python
# Before (creates view with metadata)
@tool(name="add", description="Add numbers")
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
# Creates: view with __mcp_tool_name__, __mcp_tool_description__, etc.

# After (creates Cornice service)  
@tool(name="add", description="Add numbers")
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
# Creates: Cornice service with auto-generated schema, POST-only
```

**Auto-Schema Generation:**
- Inspect function signature and type hints
- Generate JSON schema for request body validation
- Use `marshmallow_body_validator` pattern
- Support basic types: int, float, str, bool

**Discovery Path:**
- Remove: `if hasattr(view_callable, "__mcp_tool_name__"):` path
- Keep: Existing Cornice service discovery in introspection
- Tool decorators will be discovered as regular Cornice services

#### üöß Current Progress
- [ ] Analysis of current decorator implementation
- [ ] Identified removal targets in introspection code
- [ ] Planned new Cornice-based architecture

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Considerations
- **Breaking Changes**: Tests expecting `__mcp_tool_*` metadata will break
- **Schema Complexity**: Auto-generation must handle various Python types  
- **Import Dependencies**: Need to ensure `cornice` is available in decorator module
- **Error Handling**: Must maintain current error response format

#### üéØ Success Criteria
- [ ] **All tests pass**: `make test` returns 0 failures
- [ ] **Code quality**: `make check` passes all linting
- [ ] **Single discovery path**: Only Cornice service discovery remains
- [ ] **Decorator in decorators.py**: Clean file organization  
- [ ] **Auto-generated schemas**: No user-defined schemas required
- [ ] **POST-only tools**: Consistent with schema validation approach

### [2024-12-28] Filter Forbidden Tools Configuration

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Assigned**: Assistant  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Related Issue**: User request - "add configuration called filter_forbidden_tools"

#### üéØ Problem Statement
Currently, the MCP `tools/list` method returns all discovered tools regardless of whether the current user has permission to access them. This can expose tools that users cannot actually use, leading to confusion and potential security concerns.

#### üéØ Goal: Security-Aware Tool Filtering

Add a new configuration `mcp.filter_forbidden_tools` that:

1. **Enabled by default**: `True` - users only see accessible tools by default
2. **Permission-based filtering**: Check view permissions using Pyramid's security system
3. **Subrequest-based checks**: Create subrequests for accurate permission evaluation
4. **Configurable**: Can be disabled if needed to show all tools

#### üìã Implementation Plan

- [x] **Task 1**: Document the plan in planning files (CURRENT)
- [ ] **Task 2**: Add `mcp.filter_forbidden_tools` configuration setting with default `True`
- [ ] **Task 3**: Implement permission checking logic using subrequests for each tool
- [ ] **Task 4**: Modify the tools/list handler to filter tools based on permissions
- [ ] **Task 5**: Add comprehensive tests for the new functionality
- [ ] **Task 6**: Update documentation to explain the new configuration

#### üîß Technical Design

**Configuration:**
- Setting: `mcp.filter_forbidden_tools = True` (default)
- Location: Pyramid settings, parsed in MCP configuration

**Permission Check Logic:**
```python
# For each tool in tools/list
for tool in discovered_tools:
    # Create subrequest to the tool's route
    subrequest = request.copy()
    subrequest.path = tool.route_path
    subrequest.method = 'POST'  # or tool's method
    
    # Get security policy and check permission
    policy = request.registry.queryUtility(ISecurityPolicy)
    if policy and policy.permits(subrequest, context, permission):
        # Include tool in list
        accessible_tools.append(tool)
```

**Filtering Implementation:**
- Modify `tools/list` method in protocol.py
- When `filter_forbidden_tools` is `True`, filter out inaccessible tools
- When `False`, return all tools (current behavior)

#### üöß Current Progress
- [x] **Planning**: Documented comprehensive plan in planning files
- [x] **Analysis**: Review current tools/list implementation
- [x] **Configuration**: Add new setting and parsing
- [x] **Permission Logic**: Implement subrequest-based permission checking
- [x] **Integration**: Modify tools/list to use filtering
- [x] **Variable Naming**: Renamed confusing request variables (mcp_request vs request)
- [ ] **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests

#### üìù Technical Questions Resolved
1. ‚úÖ **Configuration name**: `filter_forbidden_tools` (typo corrected)
2. ‚úÖ **Applies to**: MCP `tools/list` method
3. ‚úÖ **Permission source**: Pyramid view permissions (not @tool decorator)
4. ‚úÖ **Context strategy**: Create subrequests for each tool
5. ‚úÖ **Default behavior**: Enabled by default (`True`)
6. ‚úÖ **Configuration type**: Pyramid setting `mcp.filter_forbidden_tools`

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Considerations
- **Performance**: Subrequest creation for each tool - may need optimization for large tool sets
- **Fallback**: Handle cases where no security policy is configured
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of permission check failures
- **Backward Compatibility**: Default enabled may change behavior for existing users

#### üéØ Success Criteria
- [ ] **Configuration works**: Setting properly parsed and controls filtering
- [ ] **Permission checks work**: Tools correctly filtered based on actual permissions
- [ ] **Default behavior**: Filtering enabled by default
- [ ] **All tests pass**: `make test` returns 0 failures  
- [ ] **Code quality**: `make check` passes all linting
- [ ] **Documentation updated**: New configuration explained in docs
