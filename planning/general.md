# General Project Tasks and Infrastructure

This file tracks **CURRENT and ACTIVE** tasks that are being worked on right now for the pyramid-mcp project.

## üöß ACTIVE TASKS

### [2025-06-08] Docker Integration for Pyramid MCP Examples

**Status**: IN PROGRESS üöß
**Assigned**: Assistant  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Related Issue**: Claude Desktop integration issues with path configuration

#### Problem Analysis
**Current Issues:**
- Claude Desktop expects command-based MCP server configuration
- Requires absolute paths to Python executables and script files  
- Path configuration is error-prone and system-dependent
- Virtual environment paths vary between systems

**Goal:**
- Make Claude Desktop integration simple and reliable using HTTP transport
- Eliminate path configuration issues completely
- Provide consistent Docker environment across all systems

#### Solution Strategy
**Approach:** Docker container with HTTP endpoint for Claude Desktop
```
Claude Desktop ‚Üí HTTP Request ‚Üí Docker Container:8080 ‚Üí MCP Server
```

#### Current Progress
**Phase 1: Docker Container Creation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ**
- [x] **Task 1.1: Create Multi-stage Dockerfile** ‚úÖ
- [x] **Task 1.2: ~~Create Docker Compose Configuration~~ REMOVED** ‚úÖ
- [x] **Task 1.3: Create individual pyproject.toml for each example** ‚úÖ

**Phase 2: Claude Desktop Integration - ACTIVE üöß**
- [ ] **Task 2.1: HTTP Transport Configuration**
  - [ ] Document HTTP-based Claude Desktop configuration
  - [ ] Provide admin access configuration (service-key-123)
  - [ ] Provide user access configuration (user-key-456)
  - [ ] Create multi-level access configuration example
  - [ ] Test HTTP transport with actual Claude Desktop

- [ ] **Task 2.2: Authentication Setup**
  - [ ] Document pre-configured API keys usage
  - [ ] Explain JWT token generation (optional)
  - [ ] Configure headers for Claude Desktop HTTP transport
  - [ ] Test authentication with different permission levels

**Phase 3: Documentation Updates - TODO**
- [ ] **Task 3.1: Update Claude Integration Guide**
  - [ ] Add Docker-based setup section to claude-integration.md
  - [ ] Document HTTP transport configuration for Claude Desktop
  - [ ] Provide step-by-step Docker setup instructions
  - [ ] Include troubleshooting for Docker-specific issues
  - [ ] Add container lifecycle management guide

- [ ] **Task 3.2: Create Docker README**
  - [ ] Create examples/README-Docker.md with complete guide
  - [ ] Document build, run, and stop procedures
  - [ ] Explain port mapping and health checks
  - [ ] Provide configuration examples for different use cases
  - [ ] Include testing and validation steps

#### Progress Summary
- [x] **Phase 1: Docker Container Creation** - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
  - [x] Task 1.1: Multi-stage Dockerfile in secure directory - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
  - [x] Task 1.3: Individual pyproject.toml for each example - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
    - [x] Successfully tested Docker build - image builds without errors
    - [x] Verified Docker container runs and MCP server responds correctly
- [ ] **Phase 2: Claude Desktop Integration** - ACTIVE üöß  
- [ ] **Phase 3: Documentation Updates** - TODO

#### Technical Decisions Made
- **Container Strategy**: Multi-stage Docker build for optimization, Dockerfile in secure directory
- **Security**: Non-root user, health checks, isolated environment
- **Authentication**: Pre-configured API keys (no expiration issues)
- **Networking**: HTTP transport to eliminate Claude Desktop path issues
- **Port**: Single port 8080 for secure example (simplified from multi-port approach)
- **Configuration**: Individual pyproject.toml per example, no dev dependencies
- **Architecture**: Removed Docker Compose complexity, simple docker build/run commands

#### Expected Benefits
- **‚úÖ Eliminates path issues** - No absolute paths needed for Claude Desktop
- **‚úÖ Consistent environment** - Same container everywhere
- **‚úÖ Simple Claude config** - Just HTTP URL + API key
- **‚úÖ Portable** - Works on any system with Docker
- **‚úÖ Secure** - Isolated container environment  
- **‚úÖ Reliable** - Health checks and restart policies

## üìä Current Status

**All major infrastructure tasks completed!** ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **Testing**: Modern pytest-based test suite with 94+ tests, 75%+ coverage
- ‚úÖ **Plugin Architecture**: Full Pyramid plugin with includeme function
- ‚úÖ **Tool Registration**: Easy @tool decorator for automatic registration
- ‚úÖ **Settings Integration**: Comprehensive mcp.* settings support
- ‚úÖ **Examples**: Working example application demonstrating usage
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API still works unchanged
- ‚úÖ **Security**: JWT authentication and context factory integration
- ‚úÖ **Docker**: Development environment with Docker-in-Docker support

The project now follows Pyramid best practices and provides an excellent developer experience for integrating MCP with Pyramid applications.

## Next Steps

**Immediate Focus:**
1. Complete Docker integration for Claude Desktop
2. Finish Claude integration documentation

**Planned from Backlog:**
1. Route Discovery feature completion (Phases 2-5)
2. Open Source & PyPI Publishing setup
3. Enhanced route discovery implementation

The core infrastructure is solid. Current focus is on Claude Desktop integration, then moving to route discovery feature completion from the backlog.

## üìù Task Management Notes

**Active vs Backlog:**
- **This file (`general.md`)**: Only tasks currently being worked on
- **`planning/backlog.md`**: All planned future tasks (prioritized)
- **`planning/done.md`**: All completed tasks (historical archive)

**Workflow:**
1. Work on tasks in this file until completion
2. Move completed tasks to `done.md`
3. Pull next priority tasks from `backlog.md` into this file
4. Keep this file focused and manageable (max 1-3 active task groups)
