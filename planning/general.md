**Assigned**: Assistant  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Actual Time**: ~2 hours

#### Plan
- [x] Add includeme function to main package following Pyramid conventions
- [x] Support settings-based configuration (mcp.* settings)
- [x] Add plugin-level tool decorator that works without explicit PyramidMCP instance
- [x] Add request method and configurator directive for easy access
- [x] Create comprehensive tests for plugin functionality
- [x] Create example application showing proper usage
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing API

#### Progress
- [x] ✅ Added includeme() function to pyramid_mcp/__init__.py
- [x] ✅ Implemented settings parsing (mcp.server_name, mcp.mount_path, etc.)
- [x] ✅ Added @tool decorator that works at module level
- [x] ✅ Added config.get_mcp() directive and request.mcp method
- [x] ✅ Created automatic tool discovery and registration
- [x] ✅ Added auto-commit functionality for plugin usage
- [x] ✅ Created 9 comprehensive plugin tests
- [x] ✅ Created examples/pyramid_app_example.py demonstrating usage
- [x] ✅ Maintained backward compatibility (auto_commit parameter)

#### Settings Supported
```python
settings = {
    'mcp.server_name': 'my-api',
    'mcp.server_version': '1.0.0', 
    'mcp.mount_path': '/mcp',
    'mcp.enable_sse': 'true',
    'mcp.enable_http': 'true',
    'mcp.include_patterns': 'users/*, admin/*',
    'mcp.exclude_patterns': 'internal/*, debug/*'
}
```

#### Usage Pattern
```python
# Basic plugin usage
config.include('pyramid_mcp')

# With settings
config.include('pyramid_mcp')
config.registry.settings.update({
    'mcp.server_name': 'my-api',
    'mcp.mount_path': '/api/mcp'
})

# Register tools
@tool(description="Add two numbers")
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

#### Decisions Made
- Followed standard Pyramid plugin conventions with includeme()
- Used mcp.* prefix for all settings to avoid conflicts
- Added automatic tool discovery to handle decorator timing issues
- Created fallback mechanism for testing scenarios
- Auto-mount with commit for seamless plugin experience

#### Outcomes
- **Plugin Tests**: 9/9 tests passing
- **Total Tests**: 37/37 tests passing (including all previous tests)
- **Coverage**: Increased to 69% total coverage
- **Architecture**: Full Pyramid plugin compliance
- **Usability**: Much easier integration for end users
- **Example**: Complete working example application

#### Integration Benefits
- ✅ Standard Pyramid plugin pattern (`config.include('pyramid_mcp')`)
- ✅ Settings-based configuration (follows Pyramid conventions)
- ✅ Automatic mounting and configuration
- ✅ Easy tool registration with @tool decorator
- ✅ Access via request.mcp and config.get_mcp()
- ✅ Full backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Current Status

**All major infrastructure tasks completed!** ✅

```python
# Test Classes and Coverage:
# TestMCPHttpEndpoints (11 tests)
- MCP initialize, list tools, call tools via HTTP
- Error handling for invalid requests and nonexistent tools  
- JSON parsing errors and malformed requests
- Tool validation errors (divide by zero, invalid operations)

# TestPyramidEndpointsWithWebTest (6 tests)
- CRUD operations on users endpoint alongside MCP
- Verification that regular Pyramid functionality works with MCP mounted

# TestMCPConfiguration (2 tests)
- Custom mount paths and server configuration
- Dynamic configuration testing

# TestMCPStreamingEndpoints (2 tests)
- SSE endpoint availability and basic functionality
```

#### Technical Benefits
- **Real HTTP Testing**: Tests actual HTTP requests/responses to MCP endpoints

- **Integration Testing**: Verifies MCP and Pyramid endpoints work together
- **Error Path Testing**: Comprehensive testing of edge cases and error conditions
- **Configuration Testing**: Dynamic testing of different MCP configurations
- **No Server Required**: Tests run in-process without external dependencies

#### Decisions Made
- Used WebTest 3.0+ for modern WSGI testing capabilities
- Created separate test file for WebTest-based tests to maintain organization
- Added both mcp_testapp (with MCP) and testapp (without MCP) fixtures
- Focused on HTTP-based testing rather than direct protocol handler testing
- Included comprehensive error handling and edge case testing

#### Outcomes
- **New Tests**: 20+ comprehensive WebTest-based tests
- **Test Quality**: Real HTTP testing provides better confidence than unit tests
- **Error Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of error conditions and edge cases
- **Integration Confidence**: Verified MCP and Pyramid work seamlessly together
- **Developer Experience**: WebTest provides excellent debugging capabilities

## Next Steps

The core infrastructure is solid. Future development can focus on:

1. **Feature Development**: Add new MCP capabilities or Pyramid integrations
2. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive user documentation
3. **Performance**: Optimize for production use cases
4. **Additional Examples**: More complex usage scenarios

The project is ready for real-world usage and follows all Pyramid conventions!
