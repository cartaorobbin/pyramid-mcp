### [2024-12-28] Implement Marshmallow Schema Integration for Cornice

**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Assigned**: Assistant
**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes
**Related Issue**: Missing feature implementation

#### Plan
- [ ] Locate the TODO comment in `pyramid_mcp/introspection.py`
- [ ] Implement schema extraction using existing `_extract_marshmallow_schema_info` method
- [ ] Replace the generic "data" field with actual Marshmallow schema fields
- [ ] Ensure the implementation works with the failing test
- [ ] Run tests to verify the implementation works
- [ ] Run `make test` and `make check` to validate

#### Progress
- [x] Planning phase - documenting approach in planning/general.md
- [ ] Locate TODO comment and understand the context
- [ ] Implement the schema extraction feature
- [ ] Test and validate implementation

#### Problem Analysis
The current TODO comment in `_generate_input_schema` method doesn't extract Marshmallow schema information from Cornice services. Instead, it uses a generic "data" field. The test we just created validates that schema fields should be properly exposed in tool info.

#### Decisions Made
- Use existing `_extract_marshmallow_schema_info` method for consistency
- Replace the generic HTTP request structure approach with proper schema field extraction
- Ensure the implementation properly handles required vs optional fields
- Maintain backward compatibility with non-schema Cornice services
