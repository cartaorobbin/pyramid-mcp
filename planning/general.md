### [2024-12-28] Refactor Tool Decorator to Use Cornice Services

**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Assigned**: Assistant  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Related Issue**: User request - "refactor tool decorator to use cornice services and remove MCP metadata"

#### üéØ Problem Analysis
Currently the `@tool` decorator has two different discovery paths in introspection:

1. **Cornice service discovery** (the clean path we want to keep) 
2. **MCP metadata discovery** (the `__mcp_tool_*` path we want to remove)

The decorator currently:
- Creates Pyramid views directly with `__mcp_tool_*` metadata attributes
- Uses separate metadata-based discovery path in introspection
- Lives in `core.py` instead of a dedicated file
- Accepts both GET and POST methods

#### üéØ Goal: Unified Cornice-Only Discovery

Refactor the `@tool` decorator to:

1. **Move to `decorators.py`**: Extract from `core.py` for better organization
2. **Create Cornice services**: Instead of Pyramid views with metadata
3. **Auto-generate schemas**: From function signatures (no user-defined schemas)  
4. **POST-only endpoints**: Restrict to POST for schema validation
5. **Remove metadata discovery**: Eliminate `__mcp_tool_*` attributes completely
6. **Maintain error format**: Keep current `{"error": "...", "tool_name": "..."}` format
7. **Keep naming conventions**: `tool_{tool_name}` and `/mcp/tools/{tool_name}`

#### üìã Implementation Plan

- [ ] **Task 1**: Create `pyramid_mcp/decorators.py` file
- [ ] **Task 2**: Move `tool` decorator class from `core.py` to `decorators.py`
- [ ] **Task 3**: Refactor decorator to create Cornice services instead of views
- [ ] **Task 4**: Implement auto-schema generation from function signatures
- [ ] **Task 5**: Remove all `__mcp_tool_*` metadata code from decorator
- [ ] **Task 6**: Remove metadata-based discovery path from `introspection.py`
- [ ] **Task 7**: Update imports in `__init__.py` to expose decorator from new location
- [ ] **Task 8**: Run tests and fix any issues with unified discovery

#### üîß Technical Design

**New Decorator Behavior:**
```python
# Before (creates view with metadata)
@tool(name="add", description="Add numbers")
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
# Creates: view with __mcp_tool_name__, __mcp_tool_description__, etc.

# After (creates Cornice service)  
@tool(name="add", description="Add numbers")
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
# Creates: Cornice service with auto-generated schema, POST-only
```

**Auto-Schema Generation:**
- Inspect function signature and type hints
- Generate JSON schema for request body validation
- Use `marshmallow_body_validator` pattern
- Support basic types: int, float, str, bool

**Discovery Path:**
- Remove: `if hasattr(view_callable, "__mcp_tool_name__"):` path
- Keep: Existing Cornice service discovery in introspection
- Tool decorators will be discovered as regular Cornice services

#### üöß Current Progress
- [ ] Analysis of current decorator implementation
- [ ] Identified removal targets in introspection code
- [ ] Planned new Cornice-based architecture

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Considerations
- **Breaking Changes**: Tests expecting `__mcp_tool_*` metadata will break
- **Schema Complexity**: Auto-generation must handle various Python types  
- **Import Dependencies**: Need to ensure `cornice` is available in decorator module
- **Error Handling**: Must maintain current error response format

#### üéØ Success Criteria
- [ ] **All tests pass**: `make test` returns 0 failures
- [ ] **Code quality**: `make check` passes all linting
- [ ] **Single discovery path**: Only Cornice service discovery remains
- [ ] **Decorator in decorators.py**: Clean file organization  
- [ ] **Auto-generated schemas**: No user-defined schemas required
- [ ] **POST-only tools**: Consistent with schema validation approach

## Task Organization Rules

- **Current Tasks (This File)**: Tasks actively being worked on RIGHT NOW (max 1-3 groups)  
- **Backlog**: Use `backlog.md` for planned future tasks
- **Completed**: Move to `done.md` when tasks are complete with all tests passing

When starting new work:
1. Move tasks from `backlog.md` ‚Üí `general.md` (this file)
2. Work on tasks and update progress
3. Move completed tasks from `general.md` ‚Üí `done.md`
