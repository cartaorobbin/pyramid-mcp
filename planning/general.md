# Active Tasks - Current Development

This file tracks tasks currently being worked on. Completed tasks get moved to `planning/done.md`.

## 📝 Task Management Guidelines

**Workflow:**
1. Work on tasks in this file until completion
2. Move completed tasks to `done.md`
3. Pull next priority tasks from `backlog.md` into this file
4. Keep this file focused and manageable (max 1-3 active task groups)
