## [2025-01-20] Claude Desktop Tool Name Validation Fix

**Status**: DONE âœ…
**Assigned**: Assistant  
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours
**Related Issue**: Claude Desktop client tool name validation error

### Plan
- [x] Analyze Claude Desktop tool name validation requirements
- [x] Implement tool name validation and sanitization functions
- [x] Create robust collision prevention system
- [x] Update MCP protocol handler to use validation
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite using function-based tests
- [x] Fix code quality issues (formatting, linting)
- [x] Verify all tests pass

### Progress
- [x] **Analyzed requirements**: Claude Desktop enforces `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$` pattern
- [x] **Implemented validation system**: 
  - Added `validate_tool_name()` function with regex pattern matching
  - Added `sanitize_tool_name()` function with intelligent sanitization
  - Handles invalid characters, length limits, numeric prefixes
  - Prevents collisions with hash-based suffixes
- [x] **Updated MCP protocol handler**:
  - Modified `register_tool()` to automatically sanitize names
  - Added collision tracking with `_used_tool_names` set
  - Preserves original tool functionality while fixing names
  - Logs warnings when names are sanitized
- [x] **Created comprehensive test suite**:
  - 17 function-based tests (following project rules)
  - Tests validation, sanitization, collision prevention
  - Tests edge cases, unicode handling, long names
  - Tests integration with MCP protocol handler
- [x] **Fixed code quality issues**:
  - Ran auto-formatter (black) to fix formatting
  - Fixed long line issues in tests
  - Removed unused imports
  - All tests pass: `make test` âœ…
  - All quality checks pass: `make check` âœ…

### Decisions Made
- **Hash-based collision prevention**: Using MD5 hash to create unique suffixes instead of simple counters
- **Intelligent sanitization**: Replace invalid chars with underscores, handle numeric prefixes
- **Automatic application**: Sanitization happens transparently in `register_tool()`
- **Preserve functionality**: Original tool handlers and metadata preserved unchanged
- **Function-based tests**: Following project rules (no class-based tests)

### Key Features Implemented
- **Pattern validation**: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$` matching Claude Desktop requirements
- **Character sanitization**: Invalid chars â†’ underscores, unicode â†’ ASCII
- **Length management**: Intelligent truncation preserving readability
- **Collision prevention**: Hash-based unique suffixes for duplicate names
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing MCP protocol handler
- **Logging**: Warning messages when names are sanitized

### Test Results
- âœ… **All tests passing**: 179 passed, 1 xfailed, 0 failed
- âœ… **Code quality checks**: All black, isort, flake8, mypy checks pass
- âœ… **Tool name validation**: 17 specific tests all pass
- âœ… **Collision prevention**: Successfully prevents name collisions
- âœ… **Unicode handling**: Properly sanitizes unicode characters
- âœ… **Length limits**: Handles extremely long names correctly

### Deliverables
- âœ… **Updated `pyramid_mcp/protocol.py`**: Added validation and sanitization functions
- âœ… **Updated `MCPProtocolHandler`**: Automatic tool name sanitization
- âœ… **Created `tests/test_tool_name_validation.py`**: Comprehensive function-based test suite
- âœ… **Code quality fixes**: All formatting and linting issues resolved

### Solution Benefits
- **Claude Desktop compatibility**: All tool names now pass validation
- **Zero breaking changes**: Existing code continues to work unchanged
- **Collision-free**: Prevents name conflicts with intelligent suffixes
- **Maintainable**: Clean, well-tested implementation
- **Logging**: Clear warnings when sanitization occurs
- **Robust**: Handles edge cases, unicode, very long names
