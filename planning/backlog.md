### [LOW PRIORITY] Advanced Pyramid Permission Integration

**Status**: TODO (Planned)
**Assigned**: TBD  
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Related Issue**: N/A (Advanced security feature)

#### Plan

**Understanding the Integration Challenge:**
This task involves creating a sophisticated integration between Pyramid's mature ACL-based permission system and MCP's OAuth 2.1-based authorization system. The goal is to allow the MCP server to respect and enforce Pyramid view permissions when auto-discovering and calling routes.

**Technical Design Decisions:**
- **Permission Mapping Strategy**: Hierarchical mapping (permission levels: read < write < admin) with configurable overrides
- **Authentication Integration**: Use Pyramid's security policy for consistent auth, stateless JWT validation
- **Security Approach**: Deny by default, scope validation for each tool call

**Phase Implementation:**
- [ ] Analyze current route discovery system and identify permission integration points
- [ ] Design permission integration architecture
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests using TDD approach
- [ ] Implement permission validation in tool execution
- [ ] Add JWT/Bearer token support to MCP server
- [ ] Create MCP-aware security policy
- [ ] Implement permission mapping and authorization metadata
- [ ] Comprehensive integration testing and security validation

## ðŸ”„ POTENTIAL FUTURE TASKS

### Authentication Method Expansion
- **Priority**: Low-Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
- **Description**: Support additional authentication methods (API key auth, OAuth 2.0 integration, basic auth, custom authentication policies, session-based auth)

### Documentation and Examples Enhancement
- **Priority**: Medium
