### [2025-01-30] Create Test for Protected Cornice Service with Schema Integration

**Status**: DONE âœ…
**Assigned**: Assistant
**Completed**: 2025-01-30
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes (actual: ~45 minutes)
**Related Issue**: User request for test showing protected Cornice service with schema validation

#### Summary
Successfully created a comprehensive test demonstrating Cornice service integration with pyramid-mcp, including:
- Single Cornice service with Marshmallow schema validation
- MCP integration through pyramid-mcp's automatic route discovery
- Proper validator configuration using `marshmallow_body_validator`
- Test validates actual view business logic response
- No conditional logic in test (following development principles)

#### Implementation Details
- **Test File**: `tests/test_cornice_protected_schema.py`
- **Service**: Single Cornice service with Marshmallow schema
- **Schema**: `CreateProductSchema` with name, price, category fields
- **Integration**: MCP route discovery with proper validator configuration
- **Validation**: Test passes and validates actual view response JSON

#### Key Technical Lessons
1. **Schema Class vs Instance**: Must pass schema CLASS (`CreateProductSchema`) not instance (`CreateProductSchema()`) to Cornice
2. **Validator Required**: Must include `marshmallow_body_validator` in validators tuple
3. **Direct Access**: `request.validated` is always available when using proper validator
4. **No Conditional Logic**: Tests should be direct assertions without if/else statements

#### Test Results
- âœ… Test passes successfully
- âœ… Validates actual business logic (product creation with correct data)
- âœ… Demonstrates proper Cornice + Marshmallow + pyramid-mcp integration
- âœ… Code formatted and linted (test file specific issues resolved)

#### Development Rules Updated
- Added critical section for Cornice Schema Validation with proper patterns
- Emphasized schema CLASS vs instance requirement
- Documented marshmallow_body_validator usage patterns

### [2024-12-19] Pyramid_tm Transaction Sharing Support

**Status**: DONE âœ… (Tests Passing)
**Assigned**: AI Assistant
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours (actual)
**Related Issue**: User request for transaction sharing in subrequests

#### Plan
- [x] Analyze current subrequest implementation
- [x] Implement transaction sharing between parent request and subrequest
- [x] Add method to detect if pyramid_tm is active
- [x] Configure subrequest to share transaction context
- [x] Update method naming per user feedback
- [x] Add pyramid_tm as dev dependency
- [x] Create comprehensive tests

#### Progress
- [x] Added `configure_transaction` method to handle pyramid_tm integration
- [x] Updated `_create_subrequest` to call transaction configuration
- [x] Removed unnecessary `_should_use_tweens_for_subrequest` method
- [x] Simplified implementation to work with any transaction manager
- [x] Added pyramid_tm as dev dependency using `poetry add --group dev`
- [x] Created test fixtures and comprehensive test coverage
- [x] All tests passing

#### Final Implementation
- **Transaction sharing**: Simplified approach that copies `request.tm` from parent to subrequest
- **No complex detection**: Works with pyramid_tm, manual transaction management, or any transaction manager
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of missing transaction managers
- **Method naming**: Clean `configure_transaction` method name
- **Test coverage**: Two comprehensive tests covering both integration and unit testing

#### Key Features
- âœ… **Automatic transaction sharing**: Subrequests inherit parent request's transaction context
- âœ… **Universal compatibility**: Works with pyramid_tm and manual transaction management
- âœ… **Simple implementation**: No complex pyramid_tm detection logic needed
- âœ… **Full test coverage**: Comprehensive tests ensure functionality works correctly
- âœ… **Proper dependency management**: Added pyramid_tm using recommended `poetry add --group dev`

#### Test Results
```
tests/test_pyramid_tm_integration.py::test_pyramid_tm_transaction_sharing PASSED
tests/test_pyramid_tm_integration.py::test_configure_transaction_method PASSED
```
