### [2025-01-30] Create Test for Protected Cornice Service with Schema Integration

**Status**: DONE ✅
**Assigned**: Assistant
**Completed**: 2025-01-30
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes (actual: ~45 minutes)
**Related Issue**: User request for test showing protected Cornice service with schema validation

#### Summary
Successfully created a comprehensive test demonstrating Cornice service integration with pyramid-mcp, including:
- Single Cornice service with Marshmallow schema validation
- MCP integration through pyramid-mcp's automatic route discovery
- Proper validator configuration using `marshmallow_body_validator`
- Test validates actual view business logic response
- No conditional logic in test (following development principles)

#### Implementation Details
- **Test File**: `tests/test_cornice_protected_schema.py`
- **Service**: Single Cornice service with Marshmallow schema
- **Schema**: `CreateProductSchema` with name, price, category fields
- **Integration**: MCP route discovery with proper validator configuration
- **Validation**: Test passes and validates actual view response JSON

#### Key Technical Lessons
1. **Schema Class vs Instance**: Must pass schema CLASS (`CreateProductSchema`) not instance (`CreateProductSchema()`) to Cornice
2. **Validator Required**: Must include `marshmallow_body_validator` in validators tuple
3. **Direct Access**: `request.validated` is always available when using proper validator
4. **No Conditional Logic**: Tests should be direct assertions without if/else statements

#### Test Results
- ✅ Test passes successfully
- ✅ Validates actual business logic (product creation with correct data)
- ✅ Demonstrates proper Cornice + Marshmallow + pyramid-mcp integration
- ✅ Code formatted and linted (test file specific issues resolved)

#### Development Rules Updated
- Added critical section for Cornice Schema Validation with proper patterns
- Emphasized schema CLASS vs instance requirement
- Documented marshmallow_body_validator usage patterns
