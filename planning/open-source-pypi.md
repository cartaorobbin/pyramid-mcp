## Technical Decisions

### License Choice
**Decision**: MIT License
**Reasoning**: 
- Most permissive for users
- Compatible with Pyramid's licensing
- Widely understood and accepted
- Allows commercial use without restrictions

### Versioning Strategy
**Decision**: Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
**Reasoning**:
- Industry standard
- Clear compatibility expectations
- Supported by Poetry and PyPI
- Integrates well with CI/CD

### Package Name
**Decision**: `pyramid-mcp`
**Reasoning**:
- Clear and descriptive
- Follows Python naming conventions
- Available on PyPI
- Matches repository name

### Python Version Support
**Decision**: Python 3.9+
**Reasoning**:
- Python 3.8 EOL approaching
- Covers most active installations
- Allows use of modern Python features
- Balances compatibility with maintenance

## Dependencies & Compatibility

### Runtime Dependencies
- pyramid (already required)
- Standard library only for MCP implementation
- No additional required dependencies

### Development Dependencies
- pytest (testing)
- black (formatting)
- ruff (linting)
- mypy (type checking)
- coverage (test coverage)

## Security Considerations

### Code Security
- [ ] Remove any hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Use secure defaults

### Supply Chain Security
- [ ] Pin dependency versions
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Signed releases

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Licensing issues**: Ensure all code is properly licensed
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Thorough security review needed
- **Breaking changes**: Maintain backward compatibility

### Medium Risk  
- **Documentation quality**: Poor docs reduce adoption
- **Performance issues**: Profile and optimize before release
- **Dependency conflicts**: Test with various dependency versions

### Low Risk
- **Package name conflicts**: Name is available
- **CI/CD failures**: Can be fixed incrementally

## Success Metrics

### Launch Metrics
- [ ] Package successfully published to PyPI
- [ ] Installation works on all supported Python versions
- [ ] Documentation is accessible and comprehensive
- [ ] No critical bugs in initial release

### Growth Metrics (3 months)
- [ ] 100+ PyPI downloads
- [ ] 10+ GitHub stars
- [ ] 5+ community contributions
- [ ] 0 critical security issues

## Notes & Updates

- [ ] Plan created and ready for review
- [ ] Need to decide on license choice
- [ ] Need to determine repository hosting (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- [ ] Need to set up PyPI account and API tokens
- [ ] Consider beta release to TestPyPI first
